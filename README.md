# Features

## Note About Inputs

### Datetimes

All datetime inputs should be in the format

`yyyy-MM-dd HHmm`, where `HHmm` is 24 hour time.

For example, for 15 December 2026, 2:35pm, you should type:
`2026-12-15 1435`

### Index

For commands requiring indices, they can be found by using the `list` command.

## Adding Todos

Adds a simple task to your to-do list.

Format: `todo <task description>`

Example: `todo buy pineapples`

## Adding Deadlines

Adds a task with a deadline.

Format: `deadline <task description> /by <deadline datetime>`

Example: `deadline eat pineapples /by 2026-12-12 1212`

## Adding Events

Adds a task that lasts from one time to another time.

Format: `event <task description> /from <start datetime> /to <end datetime>`

Example: `event pineapple eating content /from 2026-12-15 1200 /to 2026-12-15 1500`

## Listing All Tasks

Lists all tasks in your to-do list.

Format: `list`

## Deleting Tasks

Deletes a task given its index (can be found using `list`).

Format: `delete <task index>`

Example:
`list` output:
```
you should probably do these soon:
1. [T][] buy lemon
2. [T][] sell lemon
```
`delete 1` will delete the first task


## Finding Tasks

Finds a task whose description contains the given text.

Format: `find <text to search>`

Example:
To find all tasks with the word "marbles" in the description:
`find marbles`

## Marking Tasks

Marks a task as done. Task index can be found using `list`.

Format: `mark <task index>`

Completed tasks will be marked with a checkbox [X].

Example completed task:
`1. [T][X] sleep`

## Unmarking Tasks

Unmarks a task as done. Task index can be found using `list`.

Format: `unmark <task index>`

Incomplete tasks will be marked with an empty checkbox [ ].

Example completed task:
`1. [T][ ] wake up`

## Tagging Tasks

Adds a tag to a task. Useful for adding small pieces of information to a task.

Format: `tag <task index> /tag <tag description>`

Example:

If you have a task `1. [T][ ] buy groceries`

You can add tags to remind yourself what to buy:

```
tag 1 /tag banana
tag 1 /tag pineapple
tag 1 /tag eggs
```
and the tags will be shown at the side:

`1. [T][ ] buy groceries (banana, pineapple, eggs)`

## Untagging Tasks

Removes a tag from a task. Will remove the tag that matches the provided tag description exactly.

Format: `tag <task index> /tag <tag description>`

Example:

Continuing the example from tagging tasks above, if we want to remove the "pineapple" tag, we can do:

`untag 1 /tag pineapple`

and the task will be updated:
`1. [T][ ] buy groceries (banana, eggs)`

## Saving

Tasks are automatically saved. If you wish to do a manual save, you can do
`save`.

## Exiting

Simply say `bye` to Jimbo and he will leave.
